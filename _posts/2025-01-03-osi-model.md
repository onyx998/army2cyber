# Introduction

In this section, I will cover the general outline of what this part of the course covered. 

[CompTIA Network+ (N10-008) Course - OSI Model](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network) 

The chapter covered in the course was the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model. The OSI Model consists of seven different layers, each responsible for specific types of information. Below is a vertical list of the stack along with the corresponding data type for each layer:

- **Layer 1: Physical** - Bits
- **Layer 2: Data Link** - Frames
- **Layer 3: Network** - Packets
- **Layer 4: Transport** - Segments
- **Layer 5: Session** - Data
- **Layer 6: Presentation** - Data
- **Layer 7: Application** - Data

## Layer 1: Physical

The Physical layer is the first layer of the OSI Model and is responsible for the transmission of raw bitstreams over a physical medium. The data type used at this layer is bits. 

Examples of what can be found on this layer include:
- Optical fiber
- Radio frequency
- Bluetooth
- Wi-Fi
- Hubs

### Transmission Modulation

Transmission modulation refers to the process of varying a carrier signal in order to encode information. This is essential for transmitting data over various media.

### Data Receiving

#### Asynchronous

Asynchronous data transmission allows data to be sent without the need for a clock signal, meaning that data can be sent at irregular intervals.

#### Synchronous

Synchronous data transmission requires a clock signal to synchronize the sender and receiver, allowing for a more efficient and faster data transfer.

### Bandwidth

#### Broadband

Broadband refers to high-capacity transmission techniques that can carry multiple signals simultaneously, allowing for faster data transfer rates.

#### Baseband

Baseband transmission uses a single channel to transmit data, meaning that only one signal can be sent at a time. Multiplexing is a technique used in baseband transmission to combine multiple signals over a single channel, optimizing the use of the medium.

## Layer 2: Data Link

The Data Link layer is the second layer of the OSI Model and is responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error detection and correction. The data type used at this layer is frames.

Examples of what can be found on this layer include:
- Network interface cards
- Bridges
- Switches

This layer provides services such as error detection and correction, ensuring reliable data transfer.

### MAC Address

A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment. A MAC address is 48 bits long, typically represented as six groups of two hexadecimal digits. The first four numbers represent the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI), while the last four numbers are the device-specific identifier.

### Logical Link Control

The Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer manages communication between devices over a single link and provides flow control and error management.

### Communication Synchronized through 3 Different Schemes

#### Isochronous

Isochronous communication allows for data to be transmitted at consistent timing intervals, which is crucial for applications requiring real-time data transfer.

#### Synchronous

Synchronous communication relies on a clock signal to ensure that data is sent and received at the same time.

#### Asynchronous

Asynchronous communication does not require a clock signal, allowing for data to be sent at irregular intervals.

## Layer 3: Network

The Network layer is the third layer of the OSI Model and is responsible for data routing, forwarding, and addressing. The data type used at this layer is packets.

Examples of what can be found on this layer include:
- Routers
- Multi-layer switches
- Protocols: IPv4, IPv6, ICMP

### Logical Addressing

Logical addressing involves the use of protocols to create a unique address for each device on a network. The Internet Protocol (IP) is the most common protocol used for this purpose. An example of an IP address is 192.168.1.1.

### Switching

#### Packet Switching/Routing

Packet switching is a method of grouping data transmitted over a digital network into packets. It is the most common method of data transmission.

#### Circuit Switching

Circuit switching establishes a dedicated communication path between two devices for the duration of the transmission.

#### Message Switching

Message switching involves the entire message being sent to a switching node, where it is stored and forwarded to the next node.

### Route Discovery

Route discovery is the process of determining the best path for data to travel across a network. This can be done using static or dynamic routing. Routing tables are used to store the routes, and routers can communicate with each other to find the most efficient paths.

### Connection Services

Connection services provide the necessary protocols to establish, maintain, and terminate connections between devices.

### Internet Control Message Protocol

The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used for error messages and operational information exchange in a network. It helps in diagnosing network issues and is essential for the proper functioning of the Internet.

## Layer 4: Transport

The Transport layer is the fourth layer of the OSI Model and is responsible for end-to-end communication and data flow control. The data type used at this layer is segments.

Examples of what can be found on this layer include:
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- WAN Accelerators
- Firewalls

### Protocols

#### TCP

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transmission through error checking and flow control. It establishes a connection before data transfer begins.

#### UDP

UDP is a connectionless protocol that allows for faster data transmission without the overhead of establishing a connection. It is suitable for applications where speed is more critical than reliability.

### Windowing

Windowing is a flow control mechanism that allows multiple packets to be sent before needing an acknowledgment, improving the efficiency of data transmission.

### Buffering

Buffering is the process of temporarily storing data in memory while it is being transferred between two devices, helping to manage differences in data processing rates.

## Layer 5: Session

The Session layer is the fifth layer of the OSI Model and is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating sessions between applications. The data type used at this layer is data.

Examples of what can be found on this layer include:
- H.323
- NetBIOS
- RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol)

### Set Up Session

The Set Up Session process involves establishing a connection between two applications, allowing them to communicate effectively.

### Maintain Session

The Maintain Session process ensures that the connection remains active and stable throughout the data exchange.

### Tear Down Session

The Tear Down Session process involves properly closing the connection once the data transfer is complete, ensuring that resources are released.

## Layer 6: Presentation

The Presentation layer is the sixth layer of the OSI Model and is responsible for translating data formats and ensuring that data is presented in a readable format. The data type used at this layer is data.

Examples of what can be found on this layer include:
- Scripting languages
- Standard text (ASCII, Unicode)
- Pictures
- Encryption algorithms

Key concepts of this layer include data formatting and encryption, which are essential for ensuring that data is properly understood by the receiving application.

## Layer 7: Application

The Application layer is the seventh layer of the OSI Model and is responsible for providing network services to end-user applications. The data type used at this layer is data.

Examples of what can be found on this layer include:
- Email protocols (POP3, IMAP)
- Web protocols (HTTP, HTTPS)
- File transfer protocols (FTP, SFTP)
- Secure Shell (SSH)

It is important to note that this layer does not refer to typical applications like "Outlook," but rather to lower-level application protocols that facilitate communication over the network.

### Service Advertisement

Service advertisement is the process by which applications announce their availability and services to other applications on the network, allowing for seamless communication.

## Encapsulation & De-Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of wrapping data with protocol information at each layer of the OSI Model as it travels down the layers. Conversely, de-encapsulation occurs when the data moves up the layers, stripping away the protocol information. Each stage adds headers containing metadata to the data. For example, Layer 4 adds source and destination ports, Layer 3 adds source and destination IP addresses, and Layer 2 adds source and destination MAC addresses.

# Next Steps

In the next chapter of the course, I will cover Ports and Protocols. Stay tuned for my next post, where I will delve deeper into this important topic.
